# MetabarcodeDBsV2

This repository contains updated plant and arthropod metabarcoding reference databases produced using the MetaCurator pipeline (https://github.com/RTRichar/MetaCurator). The databases represent considerable upgrades relative to prior works (https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14975 and https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5126) and details on their production and contents can be found at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/672782v1. Refer to the 'Workflow.md' file of this project to find the commands used during curation.
